# Thorium for Windows <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/winflag_animated.gif" width="64">

__Repo to serve Windows builds of [Thorium](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium)!__ \
__*IMPORTANT: PLEASE USE THE NEW WINDOWS 7/8 REPO HERE FOR WINDOWS 7/8/8.1 RELEASES* > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-win7__ \
__*IMPORTANT: These builds require [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions)! SSE3 builds for older processors will either be here with "SSE3" in the name, or in the [Thorium-SSE3 repo](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-SSE3/releases), where I put the Linux SSE3 releases.*__ \
__*NEW:* AVX2 Builds are now being served at https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2__ &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/AVX2.png" width="48">

## Chromium fork for Windows named after radioactive element No. 90; Windows builds of https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_light.svg#gh-dark-mode-only"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_dark.svg#gh-light-mode-only">

- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).
- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed [Here](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium#features--differences-between-chromium-and-thorium--).
- I release Thorium as an .exe installer and a portable .zip. Portable instructions are in the Readme in the zip file.

For building yourself, follow instructions at [BUILDING_WIN.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/docs/BUILDING_WIN.md) (if building natively on Windows), OR [BUILDING_WIN_CROSS.md](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/docs/BUILDING_WIN_CROSS.md) (if cross building for Windows on Linux).

*Thanks for using Thorium!*
