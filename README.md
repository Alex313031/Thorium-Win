## Chromium fork for Windows named after radioactive element No. 90; Windows builds of https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_light.svg#gh-dark-mode-only"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/bulb_dark.svg#gh-light-mode-only">

- Always built with the latest stable version of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/).
- Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed [Here](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium#features--differences-between-chromium-and-thorium--).
- I release Thorium as an .exe installer and a portable .zip. Portable intructions are in the Readme in the zip file.
