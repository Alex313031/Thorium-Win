# u2f udev rules have moved from being installed by default by systemd on Debian
# systems to a separate package called libu2f-udev. Pull it in manually so that
# u2f keys will work. TODO(https://crbug.com/784010): Move this to "Depends"
# once support for Jessie, Stretch, Trusty, and Xenial are dropped.

# Try to use Vulkan when possible. libvulkan1 is not available on Ubuntu Trusty
# or Debian Jessie, so it is added to "Recommends" instead of "Depends".
# TODO(https://crbug.com/784010): Move this to "Depends" once support for
# Trusty and Jessie are dropped. Note that the dependency must still be manually
# added since the library is dlopen()'ed.

#Add unrar for unrar support
